I hardly even know &rsquo;er</h2><p>I&rsquo;m bad at writing. I&rsquo;m even worse at blogging. Nothing you can say will change my mind on that. When I sit down to write these posts I just word-vomit my thoughts onto the page with some hastily scrawled bullet points from a notepad as a loose guide. If you&rsquo;re about to mentally tell me that I could get better with practice, well you&rsquo;re probably right. But the other confession I have is that I don&rsquo;t particularly enjoy writing.</p></p></div></div></a><a class=postListLink href=/posts/cans-and-cannots/><div class=postListItem role=listitem><div class=postHeader><span class=postTitle>The only rules that really matter are these</span>
<time class=postDate datetime=2025-06-21>June 21, 2025</time></div><div class=postExcerpt><p><h2 id=1-savvy>1. Savvy?</h2><p>The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie may well be peak Disney. It&rsquo;s smart in the right places, silly in the right places, and Johnny Depp&rsquo;s portrayal of a slightly unhinged and perpetually drunken pirate is absolutely brilliant for the tone of the movie. But in all that amusement there lies a quote that has stuck with me for the past 22 (yikes) years. &ldquo;The only rules that really matter are these: what a man can do and what a man can&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p></p></div></div></a><a class=postListLink href=/posts/linked-out/><div class=postListItem role=listitem><div class=postHeader><span class=postTitle>LinkedOut</span>

I Was There, Gandalf</h2><p>Social media and I go back to the Myspace days. I don&rsquo;t mean the sad corporate version it became after it was sold. I mean Myspace in all its early 2000s glory. Every page played music and most of them looked like someone was hosting a rave. &ldquo;My Top 8&rdquo; and who got added/removed or had their rank change was a new kind of gossip.</p></p></div></div></a><a class=postListLink href=/posts/commit-no-mistakes/><div class=postListItem role=listitem><div class=postHeader><span class=postTitle>It is Possible to Commit no Mistakes and Still Lose</span>
<time class=postDate datetime=2025-05-25>May 25, 2025</time></div><div class=postExcerpt><p><h2 id=1-star-trek>1. Star Trek</h2><p>I grew up watching Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was one of those rare things that I could convince my parents to allow me to stay up to the very edge of my bedtime for. Like any young nerd in training I was there for the cool spaceships, the android, the aliens. The normal science fiction things that, I suspect, initially draw most of us to the genre. There were a lot of things that I didn&rsquo;t appreciate back then, and not only because due to the vagaries of broadcast television and the episodic nature of the show making it hard to even conceive of, much less piece together, a grander story arc in my young brain.</p></p></div></div></a><a class=postListLink href=/posts/hello-world/><div class=postListItem role=listitem><div class=postHeader><span class=postTitle>Hello, World!</span>
