Star Trek&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I grew up watching Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was one of those rare things that I could convince my parents to allow me to stay up to the very edge of my bedtime for. Like any young nerd in training I was there for the cool spaceships, the android, the aliens. The normal science fiction things that, I suspect, initially draw most of us to the genre. There were a lot of things that I didn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate back then, and not only because due to the vagaries of broadcast television and the episodic nature of the show making it hard to even conceive of, much less piece together, a grander story arc in my young brain.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
